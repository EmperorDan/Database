# Database
A database is a set of structured information. The information contained depends entirely on your subject. For a taxi comapany the information, contained within, would consist of names, addresses, pricing, ect. Whereas for a game, you would have statistics such as HP (Health Points), AT (Attack Damage), Level and so on. The information is contained in various 'Tables'. Within these 'Tables' of columns called 'Field's'. The 'Field's' house the specified statistic information that makes up the table.
